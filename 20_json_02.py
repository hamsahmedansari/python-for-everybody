# Welcome Hams Ahmed Ansari from Using Python to Access Web Data

# Calling a JSON API

# In this assignment you will write a Python program somewhat similar to http://www.py4e.com/code3/opengeo.py. The program will prompt for a location, contact a web service and retrieve JSON for the web service and parse that data, and retrieve the first plus_code from the JSON. An Open Location Code is a textual identifier that is another form of address based on the location of the address.
# API End Points

# To complete this assignment, you should use this API endpoint that has a static subset of the Open Street Map Data.

# http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/opengeo?
# This API also has no rate limit so you can test as often as you like. If you visit the URL with no parameters, you get "No address..." response.
# To call the API, you need to provide the address that you are requesting as the q= parameter that is properly URL encoded using the urllib.parse.urlencode() function as shown in http://www.py4e.com/code3/opengeo.py


# Test Data / Sample Execution

# You can test to see if your program is working with a location of "Irkutsk State University" which will have a plus_code of "867FXG3R+M2".

# $ python solution.py
# Enter location: Irkutsk State University
# Retrieving http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/opengeo?q=Irkutsk+State+University&key=42
# Retrieved 1209 characters
# Plus code 867FXG3R+M2
# Turn In

# Please run your program to find the plus_code for this location:

# Pontificia universidad catolica de chile
# Make sure to enter the name and case exactly as above and enter the plus_code and your Python code below. Hint: The first five characters of the plus_code are "47RFH ..."
# Make sure to retreive the data from the URL specified above and not the normal Google API. Your program should work with the Google API - but the plus_code may not match for this assignment.
